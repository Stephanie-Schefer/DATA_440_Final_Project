DATA 440 Final Project

## **Objective**
A program that can be utilized to classify and label the theoretically generated conformational isomers for various ProXxx dipeptides. The rationale behind this project is that the manual labeling of these isomers is something already done in my research lab, and it is a process that could definitely be semi-automated. 

For this first stage of the project, I am focused on just classifying the dipeptides as either cis or trans isomers. 

## **The Data**

The raw data will not be made publically available as it contains all of the theoretical research performed by my lab. Instead, a cleaned version of the data is uploaded, and it includes the cartesian coordinate data for each atom and the classification label of the isomer (c/t). 

## **Current Functionality**

Currently my program is able to read, preprocess, visualize, and classify each isomer. So far the labels are for if the isomer is cis or trans. Next step is validating this algorithm.  

To run the code:
- Clone the repository
- Install plotly.express if you do not have it using
  !pip install plotly.express
- Open function_playground.ipynb and run blocks
